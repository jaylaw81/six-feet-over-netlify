testimonials:
  - quote: My husband’s death was absolutely devastating. I did not have anything to
      help cover expenses and SFO was referred to me and while there were many
      questions and some phone tag, I can’t say enough how they helped lift some
      of the burden in such a horrible time.

  - quote: During the hardest times of my life Six Feet Over stepped up and helped
      me and my four children get closure. I never will forget how happy my kids
      were when they got a chance to wear they mom around their neck . We are
      forever grateful thanks to Six Feet Over my kids can talk to they mom when
      they start missing her. And that means a lot. The financial help was the
      best thing I have ever experienced.  SFO helped me and children get my
      wife / their mom ashes  and that brought closure to 5 broken hearts. I
      tell people about Six Feet Over daily  and I will continue to, even when I
      write my songs I speak about SFO

  - quote: It's been almost two years since I got the worse phone call of my life. I
      didn't know how to process suicide, and I didn't have any support either.
      While looking on the internet for help I came across Six Feet Over – they
      were such a blessing, it felt as if my Dad sent me their way. They were
      supportive and helpful, and if it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have been
      able to give my Dad a proper farewell. For that I'm forever thankful.
    author: Christina, MI
  - quote: Six feet Over was a blessing to us. They helped us get through the most
      difficult, sad and stressful situation we have ever had to deal with.
      Something that seemed impossible was made so much more easy and we will
      forever be grateful.

  - quote: Six Feet Over helped me during the process of getting back on track after
      the loss of my husband. I didn’t know where to turn to or even what the
      next steps in life would be. I was scared and lost because of the
      financial responsibilities my husband was leaving behind. Six Feet Over
      went above and beyond to help me and my family during my time in need. I
      appreciate everything Katie and her team did for me even when I just
      needed to vent. Having someone who been through exactly what I was going
      through was a major help.
    author: Anonymous, Detroit MI
  - quote: In a time that my world imploded, and I was in a fog of grief, darkness
      and fear, they were a beacon of light.  I had no idea how to manage the
      next minute of life, let alone things like funeral arrangements or how I
      was going to pay for any of it.  They were a literal lifeline for me.  I
      wish I had better words to describe the organization and the
      staff.  Incredibly kind, caring, generous, understanding, reassuring, and
      the help they gave me is immeasurable on all levels.  I am and will be
      forever grateful for the help they gave me.
    author: Denise, Livingston County MI
  - quote: Six feet over has been very helpful, kind and sincere in helping me deal
      with the death of my sister.  They offered to get counseling set up for
      the family. They kept in constant contact with me on the progress of the
      application.  They reached out to me to make sure the family was healing
      and to offer any services that they could set up.  My application was
      approved and this took a huge financial burden off of me for this
      unexpected expense of a funeral. I am very grateful to have had the
      opportunity to be in touch with such a wonderful organization.

  - quote: The financial assistance helped me because I lost my job the day he died
      as well. I worked with him at our family business based on his sole
      services in mental health to others. It has taken me several months to get
      a teaching job as I had to get my recertification that had expired
      completing 150 hours and then apply for jobs. I was fortunate to get a job
      a month ago will be starting my job this fall. This assistance helped me
      in a time of emotional and financial survival mode. I had to sell my home
      as well as I could not afford it. This assistance gave me some comfort in
      one less worry with paying for his cremations and I am forever grateful.
